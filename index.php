Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. Sorry, Data. Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'?</p>

Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? They were just sucked into space. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? Besides, you look good in a dress. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. Your shields were failing, sir. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship</p>
